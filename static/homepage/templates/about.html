    <h3>The Family Oriented Music Organization</h3>
    <p>The Family Oriented Music Organization, otherwise known as FOMO, is a family owned music store that’s been operating in Utah Valley since 1952. We are dedicated to helping provide quality instruments to musicians of all skill levels. We have seen the benefits of music in our own personal lives and we want to share those blessings with everyone who desires them. We provide instruments, accessories, repairs, sheet music, and training opportunities.</p>
    <p>We sell new and used instruments. We also sell a variety of accessories for these instruments. These accessories include reeds, harp strings, instrument cases, bows, and rosin. In addition, have a very popular “rent-to-own” option and have worked closely with local school districts to be the preferred school instrument rental company. We rent both new and used instruments.</p>

    <h3>Services</h3>
    <p>We also provide several other services to the music community. We have a team of piano experts on staff that can be hired out to tune or move a piano. In addition, we have a repair shop in the building that allows a wide variety of instruments to be repaired or reconditioned. If the repair is beyond the capabilities at our store, we have preferred partners we recommend the instrument owners use. Our company doesn’t offer lessons, per se. However, we facilitate the connection of students with potential teachers. We keep track of teachers, with information volunteered by the teachers. Contact information, credentials, and availability are some of the details included.</p>
    <p>We have several rooms available for rent. We have a large recital hall in the basement with two grand pianos. The sound quality of the room is excellent so there has historically been a high demand especially on Saturdays or Friday nights. The hall is charged on an hourly rate. We also have several smaller lesson or practice rooms that can be reserved on an ongoing basis. Many teachers find this a very practical location to offer lessons. For example, we have a teacher that reserves a piano room from 4-7 PM on Thursdays to teach lessons. The rooms are soundproofed, so guitar lessons can be held in the adjacent room at the same time as the piano lessons.</p>
